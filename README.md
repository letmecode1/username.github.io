## UDP, ICMP, and TCP
**User Datagram Protocol (UDP)**: Part of the Internet Protocol suite used by programs running on different computers on a network. Used to send short messages called datagrams but overall, an unreliable, connectionless protocol. Commonly used for streaming audio and video because it offers speed! Faster than TCP because there is no form of flow control or error correction

**Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)**: Designed to not carry application data, but rather information about the status of the network itself. Used by network devices, like routers, to send error messages indicating, for example, that a requested service is not available or that a host or router could not be reached. The best-known example of ICMP in practice is the ping utility, that uses ICMP to probe remote hosts for responsiveness and overall round-trip time of the probe messages. When you ping a remote computer, you are actually sending a message called echo request, the remote computer then replies to your message which is called echo reply.

**Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)**: The most commonly used protocol on the Internet, because TCP offers error correction
